  "overview": "Refresh Check Neynar Score with a friendly, social-first visual identity that keeps the recognizable name while elevating tone, palette, typography, and key UI surfaces.",
  "plan": "# Check Neynar Score Rebranch Plan\n\n## Direction Snapshot\n- Brand vibe: warm, social, optimistic; framing the app as a friendly companion for keeping Neynar vibes in check.\n- Keep the name “Check Neynar Score” but refresh visuals with a sunrise gradient (apricot → orchid), soft neutrals, rounded glass cards, and a conversational tone.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Brand Foundation\n   - Update `src/lib/constants.ts` with refreshed description, CTA copy, and share messaging snippets while retaining the app name.\n   - Refresh informational copy in `src/components/ui/tabs/WhatIsNeynarScoreTab.tsx` and other user-facing strings to match the friendlier voice.\n2. Design Tokens & Typography\n   - Replace the `primary` palette in `tailwind.config.ts` with the new sunrise gradient colors and add a complementary `accent` ramp for badges.\n   - Introduce `Plus Jakarta Sans` (or similar friendly sans) via `@next/font` in `src/app/layout.tsx`, wiring the className onto `<body>`.\n3. Global Look & Feel\n   - Apply the new background gradient and spacing shell in `src/components/App.tsx` (outer wrapper) so the mini app reads as a colorful card over a soft backdrop.\n   - Adjust `src/components/ui/Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` to use the updated palette, iconography, and glass card treatments.\n4. Core Surfaces Refresh\n   - Restyle `src/components/ui/tabs/HomeTab.tsx` and `ScoreCard.tsx` with the gradient hero, playful highlight chips, and refreshed buttons.\n   - Ensure supporting components (`AddAppPrompt`, `ShareButton`, wallet surfaces if exposed) inherit the new token usage without regressions.\n5. QA & Polish\n   - Run targeted linting (`npm run lint`) and smoke-test score fetching plus share flows to confirm the visual refresh doesn’t break behaviour.\n\n## Todos\n- branding-copy: Rewrite constants and tab copy for the refreshed voice.\n- tokens-typography: Update Tailwind palette and register the new font.\n- shell-refresh: Restyle the app shell, header, and footer with the gradient/glass motif.\n- tab-scorecard-refresh: Redesign the home tab, score card, and CTA components to match the new brand.\n- qa-lint: Lint and smoke-test score lookup and sharing."
